I am a software developer that enjoys bringing new ideas to life. I enjoy solving complex problems with innovative solutions with cutting-edge tools. I like to ship clean, modular, testable code.

I am also a graduate student in bioinformatics at The University of British Columbia building tools to make bioinformatics more accessible to all scientists!

I program mostly in Python and Javascript, creating fully functional applications that make my research methodologies available to the public. There is also a special place in my heart for the first programming language I learned, <span class="hover-text" title="#rstats"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats">R</a></span>.

I have always had a passion for technology, and in my spare time I like to hack things together. I also enjoy giving back to community by contributing to [open-source projects](/projects#open-source).
