I am a PhD student in bioinformatics at The University of British Columbia studying methodologies for integrative analysis of multi-omic datasets, specifically transcriptomics and metabolomics. Most of my time is spent switching between the R programming language and shell scripting.

I have always had a passion for technology, and in my spare time I like to hack things together. Currently I am digging into development more by learning JavaScript.

Other things I am interested in include:
- Running 🏃
- Baking 🍰
- Coffee ☕
