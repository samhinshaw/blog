I am a graduate student in bioinformatics at The University of British Columbia studying integrative analysis of multi-omic datasets, specifically transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. I build tools to make bioinformatics more accessible to all scientists&mdash;limited technical expertise required! 

While I started programming exclusively in <span class="hover-text" title="#rstats"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats">R</a></span>, I have since taught myself Python and JavaScript, delving deeper into modern web development techniques and frameworks. By focusing my time on software engineering, I can create fully functional applications to make my research methodologies available to the public.

I have always had a passion for technology, and in my spare time I like to hack things together. As I learn more, I have begun to give back to the community by contributing to [open-source projects](/projects#open-source).


Other interests of mine include:
- 🏃‍ Running
- 🥖 Baking
- 🌲 Hiking & camping
- 📸 Photography
- ☕️ Coffee
- 🍺 Craft beer
