## [MetaBridge](https://www.metabridge.org) (forthcoming)

An systems biology-based integrative analysis platform for integration of metabolomics data. Built in [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), this application allows users to upload a list of metabolites and get back a list of directly interacting enzymes and the genes that encode for those enzymes. Currently the only supported species is *Homo sapiens*.

<h2 id="open-source">Open-Source Contributions</h2>

Though I am still new to software development, I am eager to give back to the open source community that has helped me so much. Recently I had my first pull request to an OSS project accepted, and I am excited to continue contributing to projects I use and love!
