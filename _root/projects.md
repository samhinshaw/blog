## [MetaBridge](https://www.MetaBridge.org) (forthcoming)

An systems biology-based integrative analysis platform for integration of metabolomics data. Built in [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), this application allows users to upload a list of metabolites and get back a list of directly interacting enzymes and the genes that encode for those enzymes. Currently the only supported species is *Homo sapiens*.
