title: Installing Node.js on Linux

excerpt: How to get Node.js up and running without Homebrew.
---

Installing Node.js on macOS is as easy as `brew install`. However, on other unix systems, installing Node.js isn't quite as easy as `apt-get install`. First we need to execute the setup scripts.

## Run Setup Scripts

For the current Node.js LTS:
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

For the latest:
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## Check Global Install Path

Afterwards, it is important to check your global install path. Unfortunately, this is not always set correctly, and may default to `/usr`, necessitating elevated permissions to install packages globally. This is well documented in the [Node.js docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions), but I will briefly reiterate the commands here:

First check your global install path:
```bash
npm config get prefix
```

If this directory is not user-writeable, it is **strongly** recommended to change it. The official recommendation is to use `~/.npm-global`.
```bash
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
# Replace ~/.profile with your shell start script of choice
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```
